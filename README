The easiest way to see what's up is to just run the latest floppy.img, I keep it updated and in the git repo.

Compile Instructions:
You need gcc, ld, make, and nasm to compile.
Use "make" to compile source code, link, and create bootable disk images.
After it has compiled succesfully (cross your fingers, this is a project I work on in my super-spare-free-time-for-funsies-every-six-months-for-a-weekend) you can boot it.

Booting the image:
You'll want an x86 emulator (QEMU is easy to use, free, and lightweight) to run the resulting disk image.
qemu -fda "floppy.img"
Once you hit the grub prompt, type in something like:
   kernel 200+24 kernel.bin
   boot
except, the 200+24 part will change based on how large certain binaries are, but make (or just "make instructions") will tell you how to boot the image.
